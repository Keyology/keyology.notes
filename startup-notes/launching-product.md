How to build a product

When you are building a product you don't just start building you do thorough research and take certain steps to make sure your product idea is even worth building. In this blog post we are going to cover the process of building a good product from idea to MVP.
Choose a Domain -

The first step to building a good product is to choose a domain. I choose Digital Marketing for content creators. The goal of the product I want to build is to help startups reach a larger audience to market there product and to help content creators monetize. Now you may ask why choose a domain ? well the reason why you want to choose a domain is because it will make researching and validating you product idea much easire.

Competior Analysis -

After you choose your domain you want to research your competitors and find out what product are already avalible in the market you want to target. Now remember just because your product idea already exist dosen't mean you should not still persue your idea, remember google wasn't the first search engine and Dropbox wasn't the first to do file storage. Now after i peform a competior  analysis on my domain I found several products similar to my idea. The product in my domain are:
Famebit, Patreon, Google ads, Facebook ads, to name a few.

After Perfoming a competitor analysis you want to perform a pest analysis. A pest analysis is finding out what problems your potential user are facing in the domain you are exploring, or if there even any problems worth solving to begin with. The best way to perform pest analysis is to talk to a group of potential users. No only will talking to user help you find out what problems potential user are facing, it also helps you validate your idea. After performing my pest
analysis i concluded that there is a demand for my products. Content creator would love a platform would love a tool that makes it easier for them to work with sponsors, and vice versa  with startups. But a lot of the startup said the success of a platform like this will depend a lot on its execution.

After peforming a pest analysis you want to start working on a mockup to get more feedback from potential user. before you start designing you mock up  you want to create a user story. A user story is telling the story of the user who will be using your product. my user story is:

Dylan is a YouTuber and hobbyist twitch streamer. He loves making videos about video games and anime. Dylan has been making videos for an about a year now and has over 80,000 subscriber’s on youtube and 50,000 followers on Twitch. He looking for way’s to monetize so that he can pursue his passion for making video full time. He looks online but finds that online platform such as fame bit requires him to have at least 100K following. Then he finds a website called Gap space which allows him to create a profile with his following information link his account and Gapspace takes care of the rest.

After you create your user story you can create you mockup of your product.When you create your mockup you want to design it to be a minimalistic as posible only design what you need the product to have to function. Here is my Mock up below:




once you create your mockup you want to show to potential user and fet feedback and continue doing this until you have a good idea on what to build.

once you have a good idea of what you want to build, you want to start building a MVP and no not most valuble player. An MVP stands for minimum viable product. A MVP is your product with the most basic feature and functionality. The goal of a MVP is to get a working version of your product from your user and learn and iterate based on the feedback give to you by your user. Paul graham the founder of y-combinator is famous for saying if it took you longer than 6 months to
launch it took you too long. so your MVP should only take you no longer than 6 months and once you lauch you number 1 goal should be to get your first 100 users. Sam altman president of Y-combinator is famous for saying it's better to have 100 users that love your product than to have 1,000,000 users that kind of like your product.

Now following these steps dosen,t mean you are going to build the next instagram but if you follow these steps you will be on the right track to building a great product. Thanks for reading!!!
p.s Always use data to help you make product descion!!!
