## React Tips 

1. JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.
The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

example 

``` <div></div> ```


2. In JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

example

``` Fine in JSX:

  <br />
 ```
