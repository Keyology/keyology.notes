# Big O notation 

What is Big O notation(“O” stands for “order”) ?

Big O notation messure how long it will take an algorithm to run based on how the inputs the increase. 

The reason why as software developers we use Big O notation is because we want to know how well an algorithm will perform as it scales. 


why are Big O question asked during technical interviews?

Well my guess is companies want to find out if you can not only code but also know how to optimize and find the best solution for a problem.

n represents the number of inputs 


O(1)
O(N)
O(N^2)
O(log N)
O(n log n)
